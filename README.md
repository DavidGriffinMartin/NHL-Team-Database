# Welcome to my Randomized NHL Team Database Site !

<h3>Introduction:</h3>

  For thisproject I chose to create a website that will list out NHL team information / statistics / and their active roster at random for all 32 current NHL teams. Each click of the 'Get Random Team' button will display a random teams information, including: full name, abbreviation, conference, division, venue, date established in the NHL, and provide a link to their team homepage. It will also display team statistics for the current 2021-2022 regular season, including: points, wins, losses, overtime losses, average goals scored per game, average goals against per game, power play percentage, penalty kill percentage, average shots per game, average shots allowed per game, their teams shooting percentage, save percentage, and face off win percentage. Next to the team information and team statistics will be displayed the teams current active roster of players, including: player name, player position, and player sweater number. All information was collected and accessed from one single NHL API, using two different query links.
