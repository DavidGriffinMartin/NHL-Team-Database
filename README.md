# Welcome to my Randomized NHL Team Database Site !

<h3>Introduction:</h3>

  For this project I chose to create a website that lists out NHL team information, statistics, and active rosters for all 32 current NHL teams. Each click of the 'Get Random Team' button will display a random team's information, including: full name, abbreviation, conference, division, venue, date established in the NHL, and provide a link to their team homepage. The website will also display team statistics for the current 2021-2022 regular season, including: points, wins, losses, overtime losses, average goals scored per game, average goals scored against per game, power play percentage, penalty kill percentage, average shots per game, average shots allowed per game, team shooting percentage, save percentage, and face off win percentage. The team's current active roster of players, including: player name, player position, and player jersey number, is displayed next to the team's information and statistics. All information was collected and accessed from one single NHL API, using two different query links.
